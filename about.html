                    “Our mission is to raise funds to support the families to get their daughters married in order to save them from ailments like dowry and suicide due to lack of funds.”

Kanydaan aims to involve more and more people and raise maximum funds to help families get their daughter married. There are many who cannot afford a wedding to the extent that they are forced to kill themselves or their daughters. Hence by helping them, we are not only getting them married but also saving a girl child.

With Kanyadaan we want to take a step to stop this deep rooted ailmnt in the society. By helping fathers and young brides to do their kanyadaan and bearing all the wedding expense, a girl shall no longer be considered as a burden to the family. It will hence stop all the inequalities, deaths and suicide. Kanyadaan is considered as the biggest “daan” in our country. But we feel that helping someone to do kanyadaan is a bigger ceremony.
                                                                                                                     - K Rishitha, CEO, Founder of KANYADAAN
